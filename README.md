## About

DivBin is a mobile application using object recognition and machine learning to classify objects as recyclable, compostable, donatable, or whether it should just go into the trash. This ability is built into a demo gamification app which involves making a pledge to help stop littering.

## Installation

To install and run DivBin on your own iOS device, simply clone the repository. Run the accompanied server code via AWS. Then open the iOS version via XCode, and build/run it on your own iDevice. Make sure to sign up for keys for Clarifai, saved as `Clarifai_Client_Secret` and `Clarifai_Client_ID` under `Keys.plist`.
